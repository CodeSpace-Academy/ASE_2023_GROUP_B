## Technologies Used

### Next.js
Next.js is a React framework that provides a robust development environment with features like server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and easy deployment. It greatly contributed to the efficiency and performance of our Recipe Application.

### Create Next App
The project was bootstrapped with create-next-app. This command-line tool sets up a new Next.js project with sensible defaults, saving us time and effort in the initial setup phase.
